# 2015 Winters

This is for the people just putting their baby steps in the field of image processing.

## How to Compile:

Visual Studio people do write #include "stdafx.h"
and run accordingly

## About this

I did this in winters 2015 as a part of mentoring the image processing winter workshop organized by Robotix society.
Before this I had attended the 2014 edition of workshop as a mentee and then was the **winner** of the national level image processing competition organized in Kshitij during January, 2016. Back then the competition was about making an autonomous bot which can play the break out game. I was a freshman back then ;)
